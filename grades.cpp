/*A C++ text-based histogram for a quiz given to a class of students. The quiz is graded on a scale from 0 to 5. This is a program that allows the user to enter grades for each student using the concept of switch statements. As the grades are being entered, the program should count, using an array, the number of 0s, the number of 2s, the number of 4s.*/
