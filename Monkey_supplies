/*A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three monkeys eats each day during a typical week. This C++ program stores this information in a two-dimensional 3 Ã— 7 array, where each row represents a different monkey and each column represents a different day of the week. The monkeys are represented by integers 1, 2, and 3; the weekdays are "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday". The program first prompts the user to input the data for each monkey, starting with "Sunday" for monkey #1, then monkeys #2 and #3, followed by "Monday" for monkey #1, then monkeys #2 and #3 and so on, through "Saturday". The program then creates a report that includes the following information, each properly labeled (see below): 
-Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys. 
-The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey. 
-The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.*/
