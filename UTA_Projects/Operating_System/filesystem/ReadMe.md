In this assignment you will write a user space portable index-allocated file system. Your program will
provide the user with 2 bytes of drive space in a disk image. Users will have the ability to create the
filesystem image, list the files currently in the file system, add files, remove files, and save the filesystem.
Files will persist in the file system image when the program exits.
