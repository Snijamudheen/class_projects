In this project, we aim to design and implement a digital filter within a microcontroller to effectively mitigate noise in signal processing applications. This involves distinguishing essential signal components from noise within the same frequency spectrum to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Utilizing a Butterworth filter design for its flat passband characteristic, the project entails programming a pre-existing difference equation, calculating and applying specific filter coefficients, and embedding the solution in a microcontroller environment. This setup is expected to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, thus improving the reliability and performance of systems dependent on precise data readings.
